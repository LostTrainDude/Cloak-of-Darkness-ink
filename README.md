# Cloak of Darkness (ink)
Implementation of the classic Interactive Fiction "template", written in [ink, a scripting language for writing interactive narrative](https://github.com/inkle/ink) developed by [inkle studios](https://www.inklestudios.com/)

Written so to make use of variables, conditions, gathers, sequences, fallback choices and choices with suppressed text.
